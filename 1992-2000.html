		<p>I was born on the 18th of December in the year of 1992(but I'm actually still 17-not even legal yet). It was a stormy night in the hopsital that day, is what I have been told many times by my parents, and apparently the power went out so the nurses couldn't tell if I was a girl or boy. t_t I try not to remember these things but I have no choice since I was raised in this hospital since birth-sigh my parents are the head nurses and want me to become a nurse as well....moving onto a more happy story while I was playing at the playground in my first year at primary school some girl kissed me!!!! Of course it was indirectly but it made me so happy anyway.</p>
